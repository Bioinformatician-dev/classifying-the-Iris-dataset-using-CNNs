# classifying-the-Iris-dataset-using-CNNs


The Iris dataset is primarily a tabular dataset used for classification tasks, particularly in machine learning contexts.However, if we want to approach it using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), we would need to first create images based on the data, as CNNs are typically designed for image data.

## Installation
```bash
  pip install pandas matplotlib tensorflow numpy
```


## Step 1: Prepare the Dataset

Load the Iris Dataset: Use libraries like pandas to load the dataset.
Visual Representation: Convert the features into images. This can be done by:
Creating scatter plots of the features (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, petal width) and saving them as images.
Using different colors or patterns to represent different classes (Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica).

## Step 2: Create Image Data

Use libraries like matplotlib to generate scatter plots or heatmaps from the dataset.
Save these plots as images in a designated directory.

## Step 3: Preprocess Images

Resize Images: Resize all images to a uniform dimension suitable for the CNN (e.g., 64x64 pixels).

Normalization:Normalize pixel values to be between 0 and 1.

Split the Data: Divide the dataset into training, validation, and test sets.

## Step 4: Build the CNN Model

A typical CNN architecture for image classification might include several convolutional layers, pooling layers, and dense layers at the end.

## Step 5: Compile the Model
Use an appropriate optimizer and loss function. For multi-class classification, you can use categorical crossentropy:

## Step 6: Train the Model
Train the model using the training set:

## Step 7: Evaluate the Model
After training, evaluate the model on the test set to check its performance:
## Step 8: Visualize Results
Plot the training history to analyze loss and accuracy over epochs.
